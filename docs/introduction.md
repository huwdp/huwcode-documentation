**Who created HuwCode?**
[Huw Pritchard](https://huwdp.co.uk/)

**Why was HuwCode created?**
HuwCode is a passion project and a project to learn how interpreters and abstracts syntax trees work. HuwCode is not mean't to be a big project and is not going to complete with the many other languages out there. *HuwCode is a toy scripting language*.

**Why was HuwCode named HuwCode?**
The creator asked a few people and for suggestions for a name and "HuwCode" popped up. Huw would have named it something else with his name not in the project name.

**Is HuwCode commercial?**
The answer is No. HuwCode is under the GPL v3 license. HuwCode cannot be integrated with proprietry software. Please research GPL v3 for more information.

**Will HuwCode include classes?**
Maybe someday but due to difficulty in the code, it would be hard to implement. Also no one uses HuwCode so there's little insentive to add classes.

**Does HuwCode have a garbage collector**
This is difficult one to answer. Yes, HuwCode manages the memory for you so you don't have to worry about memory managment. HuwCode does not have a generalised garbage collector but a naive one that would not be classes as a garbage collector in the programming language industry.

**What operating systems does HuwCode support?**
HuwCode is supported on *Linux* and *Windows*. HuwCode can be run for Mac OS with some tweaking.

There's an unfinished version of HuwCode for Webassembly too! See WASM link in the menu for that.
